=====================

* Fix detection of MH folder subtype used by nnml (Gnus)
* Fix filename format generated in the /cur/ directory for maildir mfolders.
* Syntax fix in configure script

NEW IN VERSION 0.17
===================

* Support gzipped mbox folders (any file matched by a mbox= line in the config
  file is considered as a gzipped mbox if its name ends in .gz)
* Rework directory traversal for the '...' construct to speed up indexing and
  the check that mfolder isn't going to overwrite a real folder when searching.

NEW IN VERSION 0.16.1
=====================

* Remove the lockfile if the program terminates for any reason.

NEW IN VERSION 0.16
===================

* Home directory (~) and environment variable ($foo / ${foo}) expansion in the
  .mairixrc file
* Add -Q flag to skip database integrity checks during indexing (equivalently
  the nochecks option in .mairixrc file).  This speeds up indexing but loses
  some robustness.
* Add ^ word prefix to require substring search to be left-anchored
* Split 'make clean' into separate clean and clean_docs
* Improve some error messages
* Add online help entries for -o and -d
* Don't write out the database if there are no changes found during indexing.
* Fix stale information about the 'and' and 'or' delimiters in the online help.
* Add the capability to omit particular folders from indexing (omit keyword in
  .mairixrc file.)  This allows broad wildcards to be used with selected
  folders removed from the wildcard which is much more convenient in many
  set-ups.
* Avoid writing matches to any folder on the list of folders to be indexed
  (affects both mfolder option and argument of -o command line switch.)  This
  prevents disasterous loss of messages in the event of trying to overwrite an
  wanted folder with the matches.
* Implement dot-locking on the database file to prevent corruption due to
  concurrent updates.  Add --unlock file to forcibly remove a stray lockfile.
* Display message path in warning messages from rfc822 parsing.

NEW IN VERSION 0.15
===================

* Migrate to GNU Arch for hosting the development archive
* In mbox parsing, handle return path in 'From ' line only being a local part
  (reported by several people)
* Don't output number of matched messages in raw mode (to make output more
  useful to scripts etc) (Samuel Tardieu)
* Fix vfolder->mfolder in dotmairixrc.eg (reported by several people)
* Handle spaces in multipart message boundary strings (Chung-chieh Shan)
* Be more tolerant of bad multipart message boundary separators (Chung-chieh
  Shan)

NEW IN VERSION 0.14
===================

* Fix error in path (p:) searching for messages in mboxes.
* Improve usage() function

NEW IN VERSION 0.13
===================

* Fixes to support the mbox format used by Mozilla mail
* When creating vfolder directories for maildir/mh, remove existing
  non-directory at the same path, if present.  When creating mbox vfolder file,
  complain if there's already a directory at the same path and exit.
* Switch from the term "virtual folder" to "match folder"
* Fix bug in path matches (p:) containing upper-case letters - previously they
  matched on corresponding all lower-case paths.

NEW IN VERSION 0.12
===================

! Change in database file format - existing databases need to be destroyed and
  recreated.

* Indexing of mbox folders in addition to the existing maildir & MH support
* Output to mbox format vfolder
* Return exit status 1 if no messages are matched in search mode, and exit
  status 2 for all error conditions.
* Allow wildcards to be used in specifying maildir and mh folder paths.
* Searching on messages having a particular Message-ID (m:msgid expression in
  search mode).
* When indexing whole email addresses, '+' is now considered a valid character.
* Use ',' instead of '+' in search expressions, and '/' instead of ','.  This
  is to allow '+' to be used inside email addresses that are being searched
  for.  The '/' character is traditionally associated with meaning 'or', so it
  made more sense to move ',' to mean 'and'.  (Unfortunately, there were very
  few metacharacters left which don't have some special meaning to shells, and
  I wanted to avoid the need to quote or escape the search expressions.)
* Bug fix checking return status of mmap.
* Handle ">From " at the start of the message headers
* Handle mis-formatted encoding strings "7 bit" and "8 bit"
* Make every database use a random seed for the token hash function (to prevent
  denial of service attacks against mairix through carefully crafted messages.)
* Rename some options in the mairixrc file, to put the folder formats on an
  equal footing.
* Properly handle the case where a maildir vfolder exists but one or more of
  the new,tmp,cur subdirectories is missing.
* Add configure script (not autoconf-based)

NEW IN VERSION 0.11
===================

* Detect failed malloc (out of memory) conditions properly and report it.
* Improved date specification syntax for d: option
* Allow vfolder to be an absolute path or relative to current directory,
  instead of just relative to base directory.

NEW IN VERSION 0.10

NEW IN VERSION 0.8
==================

NEW IN VERSION 0.7
==================

* Fix bug : mairix likely to crash if a non-existant folder is listed in the
  conf file.
* Allow multiple folders and mh_folders lines in the conf file for people who
  have many separate folders.
* Print an extra 'comfort' message in verbose mode before starting to scan the
  directory tree.

NEW IN VERSION 0.6
==================

* When an unrecognized encoding is found, ignore the body part instead of
  aborting the run.

NEW IN VERSION 0.5
==================

* When -a option is used for search, avoid symlinking the same message twice if
  it matches more than one query.
* Fixes to rpm spec file.
* Fix handling of = in base64-encoded attachments.
* Support non POSIX locales.
* Support rfc2047 encoding in headers.
* Create vfolder if it doesn't already exist.
* Allow searching on complete email addresses as well as individual words in
  to, cc and from fields.
* New -o option to allow vfolder name to be given on the command line.

NEW IN VERSION 0.4
==================

* Support for MH folders
* Create database with mode 0600 instead of 0644 (better security).
* Add Makefile target to install whichever forms of the documentation have been
  built.

NEW IN VERSION 0.3
==================

* Various bug fixes

NEW IN VERSION 0.2
==================

* Substrings of message paths can be used as search expressions (p:substring
  option)
* = now used instead of / as the delimiter for number of errors in an
  approximate match (to help with path search)
* Bug fix when using -t mode for search with unpurged dead messages still in
  the database.
